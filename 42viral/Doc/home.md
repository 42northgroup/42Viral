# The 42Viral Project

[![project status](http://stillmaintained.com/microtrain/42Viral.png)](http://stillmaintained.com/microtrain/42Viral)

A full CMS and blogging platform to provide a scalable and robust "kick start" for projects of any size.

## Third Party Support

* Gravatar (Currently only avatars)
* Disqus
* Twitter
* LinkedIn
* Facebook
* Google+
* Yahoo! Local
* Yelp

## Data Portability

We are working very hard to make all data as portable and as standards compliant as possible

Profile data currently supports

* vacard
* xcard
* hcard

## Development

Agile, Test Driven Development.

Models, Components, Helpers and Behaviors, should be responsible for everything. While the project will provide UI and
work-flows we should be able to drop all of the controllers (except those that provide web services) and views without
losing the ability to manage the data.
