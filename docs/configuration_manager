# Configuration Wizard

The configuration wizard is an XML driven configuration tool. The XML files are stored in app/Config/Xml and they are 
used to interact with the configuration forms, these form are all actions under the Setup controller. Each XML file 
represents a single action. Each XML file represents a logical grouping of configuration variables. Each variable is 
represented by an element containing the full name of a configuration variable, it's set value, default value and 
help text. Each view's configuration form is built dynamically from the XML file, submitting the form with any changes 
will update the XML file causing the view to be reloaded; reflecting the new state of the XML file. Once you are happy 
with the XML files you can run your "Build configuration files" action. This will generate a CakePHP style configuration
file based on the contents of the XML file. The application will use the resulting configuration file, not the XML file
itself. This assures we have plenty of time to review the configuration prior to actually pushing the changes. 

## Backing up your configuration

To backup your configuration simply press the "Backup configuration files" options from the configuration managers 
main page. This will create a timestamped backup under app/Config/Backup/Xml
